### Brief
The objective states to create a **CRUD** application with the utilisation of supporting
tools,methodologies and technologies that encapsulates all core modules covered during 
training.

In Layman's terms this means to create an application which can create, read, update and 
delete information in order to display my current understanding of all the technologies 
I have been introduced to.


### Additonal requirements
The task must utilise the following technologies that I have learnt.

* A Kanban Board created within Jira
* A Database utilising GCP and MySQL (H2 used)
* Clear documentation of the design phase and a risk assessment
* A functional application created using an OOP language, in this case Java
* Front end design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Test suites for the application using JUnit and Mockito
* Utilise Git as a version control system throughout the application development process
* Backend test coverage should be over 80%
